# BTMS

Developed an innovative Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) that combines Heat Pipe Technology with Immersion Cooling and Peltier Cooling to maintain optimal battery temperatures and extend lifespan.

This innovative system utilizes a dielectric fluid medium and nanofluids integrated with heat pipes to efficiently absorb and dissipate heat, maintaining a uniform temperature across the battery pack, even under high charging and discharging conditions.

The result is a hybrid approach that ensures Optimal Thermal Stability and extends battery life, making it suitable for applications with high energy and power density demands.
